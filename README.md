Impacts on Society
Introduction to Computer Science
In this course middle school students will be introduced to the vast field of computer science through gaming and robotics. This course is designed for 7th and 8th grade students in a middle school setting. In addition students will be introduced to the basics of coding and those fundamental principles needed to understand commands in coding.
Students will start the year working through coursework in CS First to gain a baseline understanding of block coding. Once that foundation has been established students will draw from their experiences to complete hands-on labs through VEX IQ that require robots to be built, coded, and tested to perform a variety of tasks. Students will have the opportunity to compete collaboratively with students from other schools at a VEX competition in the fall. At the conclusion of the VEX IQ competition season, students will transition to working on coursework through Elite Gaming Live Academy. EGL will introduce students to a variety of computer science pathways and match them to a curriculum path designed to their interests in computer science. Students who successfully earn enough points, from completion of coursework and projects, will be eligible to participate live in competitive gaming tournaments with other students across the country.


Plan
Learning Objectives
Students will be able to compose a thick slide which will require them to research and analyze the societal impacts of a featured computer scientist, and their contributions, each week. 
Learning Activities
At the beginning of the week students will follow the Thick Slides EduProtocol to create a mini research paper on the computer scientist of the week. See below for the template they will be using and a completed example. 
Assessment
Five students will give a mini 60 second presentation on their slide. Students will be graded on completion of the slide each week and will also be given a monthly presentation grade once they have all presented. 
Outcomes
Computer scientists of the week will intentionally include under-represented groups in computer science including women, people of color, those with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQ community. The goal in choosing these computer scientists to feature is to show our students that there are people who look like them in the field of computer science, therefore showing them they can belong to the computer science community. In practicing weekly analysis of computing impacts on society students will get into the habit of looking at all advances in technology from a critical perspective.
